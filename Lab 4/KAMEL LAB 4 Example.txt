     ; KHALED KAMEL, CS 343 LAB 1
     ; THIS MC8051 PROGRAM CONFIGURES P0 AS INPUT AND P1, P2 AS OUTPUT. IT CONFIGURES T0 AS TIMER IN
     ; MODE 1 WITH INITIAL VALUE OF 00FFH. ALSO, IT DISPLAYS WHATS IN P3.0 AT P3.7 AFTER EVERY T0 OVERFLOW.
     ; T1 IS CONFUGERED AS COUNTER IN MODE 2 WITH INITIAL
     ; COUNT OF FAH.  ON EVERY TO OVERFLOW, IT DISPLAYS 55H AND AAH ALTERNATEVELY. ONCE COUNTER IS OVERFLOWN,
     ; IT DISPLAYS CONTENT OF P0 ON P2.
